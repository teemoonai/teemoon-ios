    # A Calm Start :ablobwave:
    Everything looks peaceful, the editor is open, and confidence is inexplicably high.

    ## Then Reality Kicks In
    The compiler has opinions, most of them unsolicited.

    ### Debug Mode Activated :ablobthinking:
    You stare at the code long enough, hoping it blinks first.

    #### A Small Victory
    One warning disappears and morale improves slightly.

    ##### Coffee-Driven Optimism :ablobcatcoffee:
    Surely this change won’t break anything else.

    ###### Time to Commit :100_valid:
    You hit save, push the branch, and decide this is a problem for future you.
